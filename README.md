# Project based on the course: React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller


## React commands:

- npm install create-react-app -g
- npm start
- Create a react app (struture version: 1.1.5) 
create-react-app react_hooks_router_redux --scripts-version 1.1.5
- Installing radium 
npm install --save radium 
- Updating React Scripts Version
npm install --save --save-exact react-scripts@3.0.1 or npm i -s --save-exact react-scripts@desired_version.


## React Topics

- React Hooks (Allows to use react state and other resources without writing a class, using on function based components)
- React Radium (Radium allows to use inline styles and features like media queries)
- CSS Modules (In the past, you needed to "eject" from your project as created with create-react-app (CRA) so that you can edit the underlying Webpack config. In more recent project versions created by CRA, support for CSS modules is already built-in and you can use that feature without ejecting.
